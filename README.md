# Vision-Assistance
Vision places a major role among the senses and our ultimate aim to be achieved is to develop a  device to aid the visually impaired people to navigate the outer world using various techniques  used in artificial intelligence Object Detection Inference.

This device is fitted with the camera to capture the images for object detection and for the same,we developed a deep learning model using mobilenet architecture.
Object detection using Jetson Nano and deep learning, then experiment with realtime detection on a live camera stream.
